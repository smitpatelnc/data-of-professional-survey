Flickit: Grocery Data Analysis In this project, I analyzed a comprehensive grocery dataset to uncover trends and insights into consumer behavior, product popularity,
and sales performance.
Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards that visualize key metrics such as sales by category, seasonal trends, and customer purchasing patterns. 
This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data, create meaningful visualizations, and derive actionable insights to drive business decisions.
